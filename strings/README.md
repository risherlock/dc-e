# Stealing the sound of strings: The Karplus-Strong algorithm

## Abstract

The Karplus-Strong algorithm, first introduced in 1983 by Kevin Karplus and Alex Strong in Computer Music Journal (CCRMA, Stanford), presents a novel approach to string sound synthesis using physical modeling techniques. This synthesis method offers a computationally efficient way to simulate the sound of a plucked string through a combination of delay lines and feedback loops. By employing a simple delay line model, the Karplus-Strong algorithm generates rich, resonant tones characteristic of string instruments with a minimal computational footprint. This presentation will explore the algorithm's foundational principles, its implications for physical sound modeling, and its potential applications in digital audio synthesis and sound design. The presentation will also take you through how this method can be implemented algorithmically in audio DSP modeling tools like MAX/MSP.
